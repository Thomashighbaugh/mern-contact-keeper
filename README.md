# MERN Stack Contact Keeper
[Hosted on Heroku Here](https://contactskeeperjeepers.herokuapp.com)
An exploration of the MERN stack, which leverages MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js to create full stack applications for the modern web. I thought that an exploration of the stack was in order, so I built this simple little application that is essentially useless (after all we keep our contacts in our phones mostly) so that I could explore the functionality of the MERN stack. 

## Local Development

If you wanted to build or modify the web application, or even just pick it apart to learn how it works, follow the steps below to get a copy running locally (NOTE: requres access to a `BASH` shell and `Node.js` installed within the `$PATH`)

```bash

$ git clone https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/mern-contact-keeper && cd mern-contact-keeper
$ npm i 

$ npm run dev 

```

This will start both the server and the client, enabling you to modify the front end of the application at will, as well as get a sense of how the various layers of the application are working.
